<h1>The Board</h1>

<h3>What is it supposed to do?</h3>
<p>The Board is a project where you can log in <br>
and write a message for everyone who has an account.</p>
<p>An admin can delete users and messages from the board,<br>
he can also clear the whole board altogether.</p>

<h3>What can it do?</h3>
<p>Due to time constraints none of the listed things above were able to be implemented</p>
<p>The login system is pretty broken and it doesn't really work at all. Registering is work in progress but at the time of writing this it doesn't work yet.</p>
<p>The basic SQL tables are made, you can find them and import them through <code>theboard.sql</code>.</p>
<p>You can access the most usable part of it by running it on your local mahchine and typing in the URL
<code>http://localhost:8080/login</code> to get to the login-page.</p>
